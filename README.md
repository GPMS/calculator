# Calculator
This is my implementation of the [Calculator Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)
from the Java Script section of the Foundations course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

This project is made with HTML5, CSS3, and JS ES6 features.
